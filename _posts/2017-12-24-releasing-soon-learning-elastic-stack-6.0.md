<p>The book Learning Elastic Stack 6.0 is available for pre-order. Here is what to expect from the book.</p>


<hr />

<p>Elasticsearch has been at the forefront of the big data movement. Since its initial release in 2010, it has slowly but steadily evolved into a robust <i>big data</i> store. The rich ecosystem of components around Elasticsearch - Logstash, Kibana, Beats, X-Pack is known as the Elastic Stack. Recently, the Elastic Stack 6.0 version was released. </p>

I have been working as a co-author on the book <em>Learning Elastic Stack 6.0</em> with <i>Packt Publishing</i> along with Sharath Kumar M N. After nearly one year of writing, the book is ready and is available for pre-order online.
