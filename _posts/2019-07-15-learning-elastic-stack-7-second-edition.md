Ever since the Elastic Stack 7.0 alpha release was out, I along with Sharath Kumar M N have been working on the second edition of the book<em>Learning Elastic Stack 7.0</em> with <i>Packt Publishing</i>. 

<hr />





<p>
The book covers new features introduced after Elastic Stack 6.0 was released across all components of the stack including Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, Beats, X-Pack etc. The book is for programmers as well as non-programmers to get started with Elastic Stack to solve data analytics problems for variety of use-cases.

<p>
On completing this book, you will have an in-depth knowledge of the implementation of Elastic Stack and have a solid understanding of the role of each component of the stack.
