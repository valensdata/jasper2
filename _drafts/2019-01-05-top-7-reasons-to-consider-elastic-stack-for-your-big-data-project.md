Imagine yourself embarking on a new product or solution. You are optimistic about its adoption and growth when the system hits the road. Which storage technology should you choose? Which visualization framework should you choose? Which ingestion technology will you use to get the data in the system?

You envision that your product will start small but soon it will start collecting massive amounts of data and get into the "big data" territory. You think that choosing a traditional datastore like a relational database is not an option. On the other hand, you feel that investing in a technology like Hadoop will be an overkill for the new project. You feel that it is risky because of steep learning curve for your team, and the complexity involved. 

You want the technology stack to be as lean as possible in order to iterate fast without getting bogged down by complex technology. You don't want to run the risk of being stuck with a non-scalable technology.

If you have faced a similar situation, read on. Elastic Stack brings to the table some compelling advantages to make it a really attractive choice. 

<h2>1. Rich Ecosystem to Choose From</h2>

Are you developing a web or mobile application that needs to store lot of data? Do you want to do analytics on that data? 

Are you just looking to add a powerful search feature in your application? 

You might already have lot of applications and other supporting software in your infrastructure. You want to get insights from your application logs, webserver logs. Your plan is to understand how your customers are behaving on your website.

From full-text search to analytics and visualizations, log collection, graph analysis to machine learning, Elastic Stack has components that support all these requirements. You can pick the components you need to solve your business problems.


<h2>2. Wide variety of use-cases</h2>

Elastic Stack has wide applicability like log aggregation and analysis, security analytics, product search, content discovery and so on. 

Elastic Stack provides a comprehensive set of components to collect, centralize, analyze, visualize, alert, and report the errors and significant events as they are captured in the log files of your services. It has also found wide adoption in the security analytics solutions which capture data from firewalls, switches, UTMs, and other key network elements.

Supporting product search, application-wide search across all entities, faceted search Elasticsearch can save your day. You are building an IoT solution and you are looking for a flexible data store, Elastic Stack can come to the rescue.

<h2>3. Flexibility</h2>

At the heart of Elastic Stack, Elasticsearch is a very flexible data store. If you use other structured or semi-structured big data stores like Cassandra, HBase, Hive etc. you will soon find that they require extensive data modeling upfront. You need to model the data according to your query patterns. So much so that you can perform only one type of query from one table. 

When you use Elasticsearch as an analytics engine, you just need to store the data and start writing queries. You can do search and aggregations on almost any field without much data modeling. This tremendous flexibility without compromising performance is a great deal maker. You can focus on solving your business problems rather than doing data modeling gymnastics.

<h2>4. Reduced Complexity</h2>

Anyone who has worked on Hadoop or other big data capable data stores know that they are relatively complex technologies, for the developers and the operations team. Elastic Stack offers great operational ease which is great for start-up like environments. Starting Elasticsearch, Kibana, and other components is as easy as bringing up the server which is great for developer productivity. 

<h2>5. For programmers and non-programmers</h2>

It is possible to address some complex use-cases with almost zero programming effort with Elastic Stack. Operations teams or data analysts who are non-programmers can setup Elasticsearch, Beats, Kibana, and Logstash to build a full-stack of solution that can ingest, store, analyze, and present data in beautiful dashboards with no programming knowledge. 

At the same time, programmers or developers can use Elasticsearch to make their applications more powerful. Programmers have a wide variety of choices for developing their applications including client libraries for 8 officially supported languages like Java, Javascript, Python, PHP etc. and client libraries for around 20 other languages supported by the community.

<h2>6. Performance</h2>

Flexibility offered in terms of modeling the data, does not compromise the performance in any way. Elasticsearch leverages innovations in Apache Lucene and employs many more innovations to provide lightning fast analytical or aggregation queries and search queries. Elasticsearch can perform aggregations over millions of documents in sub-second times. Ingesting tens or hundreds of thousands of events per second is quite common.

<h2>7. Massive Scalability</h2>

The performance if ingesting the data scales almost linearly with Elasticsearch. It is possible to add more nodes and achieve nearly predictable ingestion rates on your cluster. This again, helps in starting lean and scaling predictably as your product becomes successful.

These are few reasons why you should consider Elastic Stack as a strong contender for your next solution. Elastic Stack is very well suited for a iterative agile environment where you want a flexible, scalable data store which allows developing faster and also allows you to scale confidently as your product grows. Whether you are a developer, architect or a business intelligence analyst; Elastic Stack can help you build a robust solution which is future proof.
